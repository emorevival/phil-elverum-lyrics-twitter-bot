    "lyrics": "Death is real, someone's there and then they're not\nAnd it's not for singing about; it's not for making into art\nWhen real death enters the house, all poetry is dumb\nWhen I walk into the room where you were\nAnd look into the emptiness instead\nAll fails\nMy knees fail\nMy brain fails\nWords fail\nCrusted with tears, catatonic and raw, I go downstairs and outside and you still get mail\nA week after you died, a package with your name on it came\nAnd inside was a gift for our daughter you had ordered in secret, and collapsed there on the front steps I wailed:\nA backpack for when she goes to school a couple years from now\nYou were thinking ahead to a future you must have known deep down would not include you, though you clawed at the cliff you were sliding down, being swallowed into a silence that's bottomless and real\nIt's dumb, and I don't want to learn anything from this\nI love you18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "Our daughter is one and a half, you have been dead eleven days\nI got on the boat and came to the place where the three of us were going to build our house if you had lived\nYou died though, so I came here alone with our baby and the dust of your bones\nI can't remember, were you into Canada geese?\nIs it significant, these hundreds on the beach?\nOr were they just hungry for mid-migration seaweed?\nWhat about foxgloves? Is that a flower you liked?\nI can't remember, you did most of my remembering for me\nAnd now I stand untethered in a field full of wild foxgloves\nWondering if you're there, or if a flower means anything\nAnd what could anything mean in this crushing absurdity?\nI brought a chair from home, I'm leaving it on the hill\nFacing west and north, and I poured out your ashes on it\nI guess so you can watch the sunset\nBut the truth is I don't think of that dust as you\nYou are the sunset5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "In October 2015, I was out in the yard\nI'd just finished splitting up the scrap two-by-fours into kindling\nI glanced up at the half-moon, pink, chill refinery cloud light\nTwo big black birds flew over, their wings whooshing and low\nTwo ravens, but only two\nTheir black feathers tinted in the sunset\nI knew these birds were omens but of what I wasn't sure\nThey were flying out toward the island where we hoped to move\nYou were probably inside, you were probably aching, wanting not to die\nYour body transformed\nI couldn't bear to look so I turned my head west, like an early death\nNow I can only see you on the fridge in lifeless pictures\nAnd in every dream I have at night, and in every room I walk into\nLike here, where I sit the next October, still seeing your eyes\nPleading and afraid, full of love\nCalling out from another place, because you're not here\nI watched you die in this room, then I gave your clothes away\nI'm sorry, I had to, and now I'll move\nI will move with our daughter\nWe will ride over water\nWith your ghost underneath the boat\nWhat was you is now burnt bones\nAnd I cannot be at home\nI'm running, grief flailing\nThe second time I went to Haida Gwaii was just me and our daughter\nOnly one month after you died, my face was still contorted\nDriving up and down, boots wet inside, aimless and weeping\nI needed to return to the place where we discovered that childless, we could blanket ourselves in the moss there for our long lives\nBut when we came home, you were pregnant\nAnd then our life together was not long;\nYou had cancer and you were killed and I'm left living like this\nCrying on the logging roads with your ashes in a jar\nThinking about the things I'll tell you\nWhen you get back from wherever it is that you've gone\nBut then I remember death is real\nAnd I'm still here in Masset, it's August 12th, 2016\nYou've been dead for one month and three days, and we are sleeping in the forest\nThere is sand still in the blankets from the beach\nWhere we released you from the jar\nWhen we wake up, all the clothes that we left out are cold and damp just from the air permeating, the ground opens up\nSurrounded by growth; nurse logs with layers of moss and life\nYoung cedars, the sound of water, thick salal, and god-like huckleberries\nThe ground absorbs and remakes whatever falls, nothing dies here\nBut here is where I came to grieve, to dive into it with you, with your absence, but I keep picking you berries8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "The year moves on without you in it\nNow it is fall without you\nI had to close the windows and doors without you coming through\nI kept them open for as long as I could\nBut the baby got cold\nI watched the calendar bulldoze\nThis whole past summer was a lingering heatwave\nAnd I remember late August, our open bedroom window, going through your things with the fan blowing\nAnd the sound of helicopters, and the smell of smoke\nFrom the forest fire that was growing, billowing just on the edge of town where we used to swim\nThey say a natural, cleansing devastation, burning in the understory, erasing trails, there is no end\nBut when I'm kneeling in the heat throwing out your underwear\nThe devastation is not natural or good, you do belong here\nI reject nature, I disagree\nIn the hazy light of forest fire smoke, I looked across at the refineries and thought that the world was actually constantly ending\nAnd the smell and roar of the asphalt truck that was idling just out the window, tearing up our street\nI missed you, of course\nAnd I remember thinking the last time it rained here you were alive still\nAnd that this same long heat that I was in contained you\nAnd in this same heat, I opened the window next to you on your last morning\nSo you could breathe, and then so you could ghost away\nAnd now so the room will hopefully stop whispering\nThe grind of time I'm not keeping up with\nThe leaf on the ground pokes at my slumbering grief\nWalking around, severed, lumbering\nBut slowly, sovereignty reasserts itself\nI don't want it though, and betrayal whines\nWho and how could I...

    "title": "Soria Moria by Mount Eerie",
    "lyrics": "Slow pulsing\nRed tower lights\nAcross a distance\nRefuge in the dust\nAll my life I can remember longing\nLooking across the water and seeing lights\nWhen I was five or six, we were camping in the islands in July. The tall yellow grass and the rose hips fragrant after sunset. Island beyond island. Undulating and familiar. Not far from home, with my fragrant, whittled, cedar driftwood dagger in the mildew canvas tent, I saw fireworks many miles away but didn't hear them, and I felt a longing, a childish melancholy, and then I went to sleep and the aching was buried, dreaming, aging, reaching for an idea of somewhere other than this place that could fold me in clouded yearning for nowhere actually reachable. The distance was the point\nAnd then when I was twenty-four, I followed this ache to an arctic Norwegian cabin where I said \"fuck the world\" in a finally satisfying way. I stayed through the winter and emerged as an adult holding a letter from you, an invitation, so I flew back and drove back and when we met in person it was instant. It didn't matter where we lived as long as we were together and that was really true for thirteen years. And the whole time still\n\nSlow pulsing\nRed tower lights\nAcross a distance\nRefuge in the dust\nIn January, you were alive still but chemo had ravaged and transformed your porcelain into some other thing, something jaundiced and fucked. They put you in the hospital in Everett so I gave the baby away and drove up and down I-5 every night like a satellite bringing you food that you wanted, returning at night to sleep in our bed, cold. I went back to feel alone there, all past selves and future possibilities on hold while I tore through the dark on the freeway, the old yearning burning in me\nI knew exactly where the road bent around\nWhere the trees opened up and I could see\nWay above the horizon\nBeyond innumerable islands\nThe towers on top of the mountain lit up slowly, silently beaconing as if to say, \"Just keep going. There is a place where a wind could erase this for you and the branches could white noise you back awake.\" So I went back to feel alone there but cradled you in me. (In the National Gallery in Oslo there's a painting called Soria Moria. A kid looks across a deep canyon of fog at a lit up inhuman castle or something.)\nI have not stopped looking across the water from the few difficult spots where you can see that the distance from this haunted house where I live to Soria Moria is a real traversable space\nI'm an arrow now\nMid air\nSlow pulsing\nRed tower lights\nAcross a distance\nRefuge in the dust3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "But I don't believe in ghosts or anything, I know that you are gone and that I'm carrying some version of you around\nSome untrustworthy old description in my memories\nAnd that must be your ghost taking form, created every moment by me dreaming you so\nAnd is it my job now to hold whatever's left of you for all time? And to re-enact you for our daughter's life?\n\nI do remember when I was a kid and realized that life ends and is just over; that a point comes where we no longer get to say or do anything\nAnd then what? I guess just forgotten\nAnd I said to my mom that I hoped to do something important with my life\nNot be famous, but just remembered a little more, to echo beyond my actual end\nAnd my mom laughed at this kid trying to wriggle his way out of mortality, of the final inescapable feral scream\nBut I held that hope and grew up wondering what dying means Unsatisfied, ambitious and squirming\n\nThe first dead body I ever saw in real life, was my great-grandfather's\nEmbalmed in a casket in Everett, in a room by the freeway\nWhere they talked me into reading a thing from the Bible\nAbout walking through a valley in the shadow of death\nBut I didn't understand the words, I thought of actually walking through a valley in a shadow, with a backpack and a tent\nBut that dead body next to me spoke clear and metaphor-free\n\nIn December 2001 after having spent the summer and fall traveling mostly alone around\nThe country that was spiraling into war and mania, little flags were everywhere\nI was living on the periphery as a twenty-three-year-old wrapped up in doing what I wanted\nAnd it was music and painting on newsprint\nAnd eating all the fruit from the tree like Tarzan, or Walt Whitman Voracious, devouring life, singing my songs\nSleeping in yards without asking permission\nBut that December I was shaken by a pregnancy scare\nFrom someone that I'd been with for only one night, many states away, who I hadn't planned to keep knowing\nA young and embarrassing over-confident animal night\nAnd the terror of the idea of fatherhood at twenty-three destroyed my foundation, and left me freaked out and wandering around mourning the independence and solitude that defined me then\n\nThough my life is a galaxy of subtleties\nMy complex intentions and aspirations do not matter at all\nIn the face of the crushing flow of actual time\nI saw my ancestors as sad and misunderstood in the same way\nThat my descendants will squint back through a fog trying to see\nSome polluted version of all I meant to be in life\nTheir recollections pruned by the accidents of time, what got thrown away, and what gets talked about at night\nBut she had her period eventually and I went back to being twenty-three\n\nEleven years later I was traveling alone again on an airplane from New Zealand to Perth, Western Australia\nVery alone, so far away from you and the home that we had made\nI watched a movie on the plane about Jack Kerouac, a documentary going deeper than the usual congratulations\nThey interviewed his daughter, Jan Kerouac, and she tore through the history\nShe told about this deadbeat drinking, watching Three Stooges on TV\nNot acknowledging his paternity, abandoning the child, taking cowardly refuge in his self-mythology\n\nAnd when she spoke I heard your voice telling me about the adults who had abandoned you as a sweet kid and left you to grow precariously\nAnd when she spoke I looked in her face and saw you looking back at me\nOn a tiny airplane seat screen at the bottom of the world\nI saw a French-Canadian resemblance, and I heard suffering echoing\nA lineage of bad parents and strong daughters withstanding\nAnd she had black hair and freckles and pale skin just like you, and she told the hard truth and slayed the gods just like you\nI saw the cracks in the façade of posterity\nI missed you so I went home\nThe second dead body I ever saw was you, Geneviève\nWhen I watched you turn from alive to dead, right here in our house\nAnd I looked around the room and asked “Are you here?”, and you weren't, and you are not here, I sing to you though\nI keep you breathing through my lungs in a constant, uncomfortable stream of memories trailing out until I am dead too\nAnd then eventually the people who remember me will also die\nContaining what it was like to stand in the same air with me, and breathe and wonder why\n\nAnd then distortion\nAnd then the silence of space\nThe Night Palace\nThe ocean blurring\nBut in my tears right now\nLight gleams3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "I know no one now\nNow I say \"you\"\n\nNow after the ground has opened up\nNow after you died\nI wonder what could beacon me forward into the rest of life\nI can glimpse occasional moments\nGleaming like bonfires burning from across the fjord\n\nIn a painting from around 1915 called \"Midsummer Eve Bonfire\" by Nikolai Astrup\nThat shines on my computer screen in 2017 on the awful July ninth\nThe house is finally quiet and still with the child asleep upstairs\nSo I sit and notice the painting of bonfires on the hillside\nAnd hanging smoke in the valleys\nWrapping back up through the fjords at dusk\nHovering like scars of mist draped along the ridges\nAbove couples dancing in the green twilight around fires\nAnd in the water below, the reflections of other fires from other parties\nIlluminate the depths and glitter shining and alone\n\nEveryone is laughing and there's music\nAnd a man climbs up the hill pulling a juniper bough to throw into the fire\nTo make some sparks rise up to join the stars\nThese people in the painting believed in magic and earth\nAnd they all knew loss\nAnd they all came to the fire\nI saw myself in this one young woman in the foreground\nWith a look of desolation and a body that looked pregnant\nAs she leaned against the moss-covered rocks off to the side\nApart from all the people celebrating midsummer\nI knew her person was gone just like me\nAnd just like me, she looked across at the fires from far away\nAnd wanted something in their light to say:\n\n\"Live your life, and if you don't the ground is definitely ready at any moment to open up again, to swallow you back in\nTo digest you back into something useful for somebody\"\nAnd meanwhile above all these Norwegians dancing in the twilight the permanent white snow gleamed\nYou used to call me \"Neige Éternelle.\"\n\nThe man who painted this girl's big black eyes, gazing\nDrawing the fire into ourselves standing alone\nNikolai Astrup, he also died young at 47\nRight after finishing building his studio at home\nWhere he probably intended to keep on painting his resonant life into old age\n\nBut sometimes people get killed before they get to finish all the things they were going to do\nThat's why I'm not waiting around anymore\nThat's why I tell you that I love you\nDoes it even matter what we leave behind?\nI'm flying on an airplane over the Grand Canyon\nImagining the strangers going through the wreckage of this flight if it were to crash\nAnd would anyone notice or care, gathering up my stuff from the desert below?\nWould they investigate the last song I was listening to?\nWould they go through my phone and see the last picture I ever took\nWas of our sleeping daughter early this morning\nGetting ready to go, and I was struck by her face\nSweet in the blue light of our dim room?\nWould they follow the thread back and find her there?\n\nI snap back out of this plane crash fantasy still alive\nAnd I know that's not how it would go\nI know the actual mess that death leaves behind\nJust gets bulldozed in a panic by the living, pushed over the waterfall\nBecause that's me now, holding all your things\nResisting the inevitable flooding of the archives\nThe scraps distributed by wind\nA life's work just left out in the rain\nBut I'm doing what I can to reassemble a poor substitute version of you\nMade of the fragments and drawings that you left behind\nI go through your diaries and notebooks at night\nI'm still cradling you in me\nThere's another Nikolai Astrup painting from 1920\nCalled \"Foxgloves\" that hangs on the fridge\nAnd I look at it every morning and every night before bed\nSome trees have been cut down next to a stream\nFlowing through a birch grove in late spring\nAnd two girls that look like you gather berries in baskets\nHunched over like young animals, grazing with their red dresses against the white birch tree trunks interweaving beneath the clattering leaves\nThe three stumps in the foreground remind me that everything is fleeting (As if reminding is what I need)\n\nBut then the foxgloves grow\nAnd I read that the first flowers that return to disturbed ground\nLike where logging took place\nOr where someone like me rolled around wailing in a clearing\n\nWell, now I don't wonder anymore\nIf it's significant that all these foxgloves spring up\nOn the place where I'm about to build our house\nAnd go to live in, let you fade in the night air\nSurviving with what dust is left of you here\nNow you will recede into the paintings3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "Slow pulsing\nRed tower lights\nAcross a distance\nRefuge in the dust\nAll my life I can remember longing\nLooking across the water and seeing lights\nWhen I was five or six, we were camping in the islands in July. The tall yellow grass and the rose hips fragrant after sunset. Island beyond island. Undulating and familiar. Not far from home, with my fragrant, whittled, cedar driftwood dagger in the mildew canvas tent, I saw fireworks many miles away but didn't hear them, and I felt a longing, a childish melancholy, and then I went to sleep and the aching was buried, dreaming, aging, reaching for an idea of somewhere other than this place that could fold me in clouded yearning for nowhere actually reachable. The distance was the point\nAnd then when I was twenty-four, I followed this ache to an arctic Norwegian cabin where I said \"fuck the world\" in a finally satisfying way. I stayed through the winter and emerged as an adult holding a letter from you, an invitation, so I flew back and drove back and when we met in person it was instant. It didn't matter where we lived as long as we were together and that was really true for thirteen years. And the whole time still\n\nSlow pulsing\nRed tower lights\nAcross a distance\nRefuge in the dust\nIn January, you were alive still but chemo had ravaged and transformed your porcelain into some other thing, something jaundiced and fucked. They put you in the hospital in Everett so I gave the baby away and drove up and down I-5 every night like a satellite bringing you food that you wanted, returning at night to sleep in our bed, cold. I went back to feel alone there, all past selves and future possibilities on hold while I tore through the dark on the freeway, the old yearning burning in me\nI knew exactly where the road bent around\nWhere the trees opened up and I could see\nWay above the horizon\nBeyond innumerable islands\nThe towers on top of the mountain lit up slowly, silently beaconing as if to say, \"Just keep going. There is a place where a wind could erase this for you and the branches could white noise you back awake.\" So I went back to feel alone there but cradled you in me. (In the National Gallery in Oslo there's a painting called Soria Moria by Theodor Kittelsen. Where a kid is looking across a deep canyon of fog at a lit up inhuman castle or something yellow in the distance.)\nI have not stopped looking across the water from the few difficult spots where you can see that the distance from this haunted house where I live to Soria Moria is a real traversable space\nI'm an arrow now\nMid air\nSlow pulsing\nRed tower lights\nAcross a distance\nRefuge in the dustEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

It's August 12th, 2016\nYou've been dead for one month and three days and we are sleeping in the forest\nThere is sand still in the blankets from the beach\nWhere we released you from the jar\nWhen we wake up, all the clothes that we left out are cold and damp just from the air permeating\nThe ground opens up\nSurrounded by growth\nNurse logs with layers of moss and life, young cedars, the sound of water, thick salal, and god-like huckleberries\nThe ground absorbs and remakes whatever falls\nNothing dies here\nBut here is where I came to grieve, to dive into it with you, with your absence\nBut I keep picking you berriesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "A crow that's being dreamed\nBy a child who's being carried through the forest\nSleeping, wondering in her twilight half-awareness\nWhere her mother went\nI know that you died\nBut in this child's crow dream you survive\n\nBeneath layers of magical symbolic wild animals\nInhabiting the edges of our fogged-over consciousnesses\nGrasping for something to hold\nSomething old\nLike a name cut into a stone\nOr a bird that will make eye contact\n\nThat's where you live now\nOr at least that's where I hold you\nAnd we're still here without you\nSleeping and the sun's coming up\nIn the ruins of our household, we wake up again\nComing back into this\nEvery day that comes, the echo of you living here gets quieter\nObscured by the loud wind of us now\nWailing and moaning for you\nBut also living, talking about school\nMaking food, just surviving and still containing love\nWaking up again, the baby that you knew is now a kid\nAnd when she looks at me with your eyes the shape of almonds\nI am stirred inside and reemerge\nI go downstairs and turn on CBC and make some coffee\nAnd boil two eggs and make two pieces of bread into toast\nAnd open the window and give the child some clothes\nAnd get us sitting at the table\nWhere your chair still sits across from me, watching\nI stand up to put on music\nOur daughter sees and asks for mama's record\nAnd she's staring at the speaker with this look of recognition\nPutting it together that it's you singing\nI'm sobbing and eating eggs again\nYou're a quiet echo on loud wind\nBut when I'm trying to, I see you everywhere\nIn plants and birds and in our daughter\nIn the sun going down and coming up and in whatever\nAnd the myths that used to get told around the fire\nWhere a seal's head pokes up through from underwater\nCrossing a threshold between two worlds, yours and mine\nWe were skeletally intertwined once\nBut now I notice ravens instead\nI don't see you anywhere\nIf you still hang in the branches\nLike burnt wood, I will go out beneath\nWith arms reached and run my fingers through the air\nWhere you breathed, touching your last breath\nReaching through to the world of the gone with my hand emptyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "I remember looking around a hospital waiting room\nFull of people all absorbed in their own personal catastrophes\nAll reading books like Being Mortal, all with a look in their eyes\nAnd I remember still feeling like, \"No, no one can understand\"\n\"No, my devastation is unique\"\n\nBut people get cancer and die\nPeople get hit by trucks and die\nPeople just living their lives\nGet erased for no reason\nWith the rest of us watching from the side\n\nAnd some people have to survive\nAnd find a way to feel lucky to still be alive\nTo sleep through the night\n\nI wrote down all the details of how my house fell apart\nHow the person I loved got killed by a bad disease\nOut of nowhere for no reason and me living in the blast zone\nWith our daughter and etcetera\nI made these songs\nAnd the next thing I knew I was standing in the dirt\nUnder the desert sky at night outside Phoenix\nAt a music festival that had paid to fly me in\nTo play these death songs to a bunch of young people on drugs\nStanding in the dust next to an idling bus\nWith Skrillex inside and the sound of subwoofers in the distance\nI had stayed up til three\nTalking to Weyes Blood and Father John Misty\nAbout songwriting in the backstage bungalows\nEating fruit and jumping on the bed like lost children\nExploding across the earth in a self-indulgent all-consuming\nWreck of ideas that blot out the stars\nTo be still alive felt so absurd\nPeople get cancer and die\nPeople get hit by trucks and die\nPeople just living their lives get erased for no reason\nWith the rest of us averting our eyes\n\nWhen I was leaning on Skrillex's tour bus waiting for the hotel shuttle in the middle of the night\nI barely knew who I was\nI looked up and saw Orion wielding a club and a shield\nAnd there you were again:\nMajestic dead wife\nAs my grief becomes calcified, frozen in stories\nAnd in these songs I keep singing, numbing it down\nThe unsingable real memories of you\nAnd the feral eruptions of sobbing\n\nThese waves hit less frequently\nThey thin and then they are gone\nYou are gone and then your echo is gone\nAnd then the crying is gone\nAnd what is left but this merchandise?\n\nThis is what my life feels like now\nLike I got abruptly dropped off by the side of the road\nIn the middle of a long horrible ride\nIn a hot van that was too full of confident chattering dudes\nAnd the sound of tires receding\nTaking in the night air I say\n\"Now only\"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

haul\nWounds and loves unresolved\nI wake up with the sun in my eyes\nThe present moment tries\nBut now I'm back where I was when I was twenty\nCrashing through salal alone and mumbling\nOne moment thinking I'm wise\nAnd in the next one I writhe\nTrying to re-remind myself of something learned then forgotten\nCountless sunrises burying the things\nI'd figured out the day before\nLike that I probably won't find shelter\nIn the arms of any other person\nThough I will try\nAgain, I'll deny\nThe blanketing sky\nThe thing I just realised\nFor probably the millionth time\nThat walking with my knees trembling\nIs the true state of all things\nThe true state of all things is a waterfall\nWith no bottom crashing end\nAnd no ledge to plummet off\nFull of debris and flowers, never not falling\nAnd in it we swim and fall\nSometimes beside\nOften apart\nIt's just chaos heaving\nI wake up with the sun in my eyes\nBeneath present moment skies\nSquinting and wondering how I got here\nGoing through the contents of my backpack\nShaking out the dust to bring some empty space back\nFilling a long merch table with artifacts\nLooking back to see if I could draw a map\nThat leads to now\nI remember where I was\nWhen I was twenty, or seventeen, or twenty-three\nThe disinterested sun would still rise every morning\nSame as now\nDawn was loud\nI took my breakfast to the couch on the porch of the punk house\nCoffee and low tide smell and my life stretching out\nSpending hours each morning reading poems and staring off\nAnd then snapping back to urgency, I did my dishes\nAnd then I would sprint\nTo the studio again\nSpend all day and night digging in\nDistorted bass, spliced tape\nSinging lines like: \"There's no end\"\nAnd \"I won't look for you in my room\"\nAbout my friends\nI would drive out to the ocean and not tell anybody\nI watched Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in a dollar theatre in Aberdeen\nIt was a rainy matinée, 2001, Sunday, March 18th\nAnd in the parking lot afterward\nFor a few minutes in the rain\nI stood glowing with ideas\nOf what I might try to convey with this music\nAt that moment, my mind flashing like a blade\nA twenty-two-year-old in flip-flops\nRunning around in an empty mall parking lot\nLost in a martial arts fantasy\nIt looks ridiculous now\nBut the truth is that alone there\nSomething was formed\nThe way they held themselves upright with tea in the opening scenes\nA warm formality, spines straight and feet planted wide\nUntipoverable like the bamboo'd undulating hills\nWalking slowly, making eye contact and gliding\nThe sound of empty wind when they sword fought weightless in the bamboo\nWith a purity of heart that transcends gravity\nLeaping off the mountain into ambiguity\nFalling slow\nAs the end credits rolled\nI decided I would try to make music that contained this deeper peace\nBuried underneath distorted bass\nFog imbued with light and emptiness\nI kept on driving out to the ocean\nIt was raining so hard, I was wet wool caked with sand\nI watched the dunes migrate slowly\n\nLost mind in the tall grass\nAnd slowly the sound\nOf roaring waves returned\nI rose\nI returned to my station wagon with a wet face\nExtravagant solitude invigorates\nI drove back to Olympia clear-headed\nTemporarily\nAnd went back into the studio to resume whatever this thing is\nThis spooling out repetitive decades long song string\nThis river coursing through my life\nThese wild swipes at meaning\nAnd now I circle back to look into the spring\nWhen I was seventeen\nIt was 1995\nI put the name \"Microphones\" on the tapes I would make late at night after work at the record store\nI was already by then a couple years deep into this weird pursuit\nPlaying drums, copying lyrics out to hang them in my room\nUntil I started making my own embarrassing early tries\nAt this thing that sings at night above the house\nBranches in the wind\nBending wordlessly\nI wanted to capture it on tape\nAt first, I called my recordings a different name\nI called it \"The Microphones\" on the third cassette I made\nBecause I loved recording and the equipment seemed to be living\nAnd it sang to me like static interference\nFrom the small AM radio station down the street\nNight in Anacortes in the mid-90s, oil tankers rumbling\nI stayed late recording every night\nThen I drove back to my parents' house\nMy headlights through the trees along Heart Lake Road\nWinding down the dark slope\nBeneath Mount Erie\nI was already who I am\nA bottle of India ink, masking tape\nJulie Doiron, Tori Amos, Cranberries, Sinéad O'Connor\nEric's Trip, Red House Painters, Sonic Youth, This Mortal Coil\nKurt Cobain had died\nI had my driver's license and a girlfriend\nAnd we'd cling to each other and dream that anything's permanent\nEven back then\nThe beast of uninvited change\nInsisted itself in\nAnd look here, it still hangs\nBut when I was young (Young)\nI'd go driving in the rain\nI saw Stereolab in Bellingham and they played one chord for fifteen minutes\nSomething in me shifted\nI brought back home belief I could create eternity\nLeaning the guitar up on the amp, taping down organ keys\nFeeding back forever distorted waves of cymbals oceany\nSlowly starting to try the move the words beyond\nMere melancholy\nInto something that rings\nTrue and old and useful hopefully\nBut when I was seventeen, I sang\nIn the moment, hurt romantically\nGrasping in the dark\nLike: \"Shadows of the moon...\"\n\"On the back of the car seat...\"\n\"Where she sat once\"\nIt's not that bad, but I know I wanted to go deeper beneath pain\nBeneath the human\nIs it because my parents barely had any money\nAnd preferred to leave the baby in the garden\nThat I grew up to blur the boundary\nBetween myself and the actual churning dirt of this place?\nThat it feels normal to me to speak with the voice of weather\nTo build and move into a mirage\nMade of songs cascading down a rock face in a homemade myth?\nEven deeper back into the mist\nWhen I was twelve or thirteen\nOn a family trip, we hiked down a steep bluff to an ocean beach in whipping rain\nMy little brother's clothes got wet from playing in the winter waves\nMy parents made a fire of smokey driftwood and we huddled in\nAnd took his wet clothes off and held him naked above the flames\nSmelling like smoke and salt on the drive home\nSurely this experience explains something about whoever it was that sang all these songs\nWhen you're younger, every single things vibrates with significance\nGazing at the details in the artwork of a 7-inch\nDevouring every word in a zine\nThere was barely internet\nMeaning gets attributed wherever appetite bestows a thing\nWith resonating glowing ringing out through a life\nWhat from these times do I carry with me still?\nThe things I survive return repeatedly\nAnd I find again that I am a newborn every time\nWhen I wake alone in the dark\nAgain, I swim\nOut into the lake of the heart\nAnd in\nMm...\n\nWhen I got back to Olympia from the ocean\nI woke up early before dawn to start recording\nThe things I wanted to communicate had to do\nWith finding out how to break out from seeing\nOnly the inside of reflected ocean on the sky\nIt was early 2001 and I was almost twenty-three\nI'd finished recording The Glow Pt. 2\nAnd I was either always on tour or setting up a tour\nAlways running, voracious, thirsty\nI'd go out to the lake with friends\nSwim out to the middle and dive as far as I could\nDown to where the water gets cold, with open eyes\nWe'd go up on the roof at night and actually contemplate the moon\nMy friends and I just trying to blow each others' minds\nJust lying there gazing, young and ridiculous\nAnd we meant it, our eyes watering\nThe moon without abstraction\nThen became a floating ball of a rock in outer space\nNot a sticker or a light or a hole through black paper\nWe were making food and records and paintings\nAnd walking around beneath a real infinity\nI felt my size\nThat brief dissipating shock of looking into outer space\nAnd seeing, for just a second, the bottomless distance pressed against my face\nMy little mind trying to write it down, zooming out\nA faint yelp lost in a thunderstorm\nSufficiently small, thinking on the geologic scale\nMaking the voice of mountains\nReaching beyond my old concerns\nFrom when I was seventeen in 1995\nAll the layers of life\nGlint in my flashing eye\nSimultaneously\nAnd at any moment we could die\nAnd so with urgency\nI keep a candle by my side\nAnd watch it disappear and glow\nAt the same time\nThe weather moves across the land and doesn't have a reason\nThis rippling uncertainty beneath our bones\nIs still\nThe true state of all things\nIt was at a truck stop in northern Italy\nI was on tour playing drums and always wandering off alone\nSquinting into the setting sun\nMy notebook filling\nI was touring, living on an alternate plane within\nBut set apart from this life\nWhere people wake and work and don't self-uproot each day\nInstead we passed through the towns like criminals\nI was so gladly included in this rare world\nThis moving cult of groundlessness\nRoomless, moving, awake\nAcross that parking lot, recognition of the same\nAnother touring American band\nBonnie 'Prince' Billy\nAll dressed in matching track suits and sunglasses\nGrizzled and silly\nA kind of Italian tour costume\nBlending in, but not really\nAnd their playfulness with persona\nLiberated me with permeability\nI thought, \"Who is it even that sings\nAnd who comes to life\nBetween the ears of the hearers in the rooms at night\nAnd how can we all get deep?\"\nThe packaging distracts from the nourishment it wraps\nFixation on the singer's face or on the band's name\nKeeps us groveling and blind at the edge of a sea\nUnsubmerged in the singing waterfall\nLooking for a door into The Mansion\nTaking this weird art project out into public\nIndulging in cultivated ambiguity\nAbout participants' identities\nLetting misperceptions hang\nBecause nothing's really true\nWith this imagined collective called \"The Microphones\"\nI wrote about climbing up and dying\nAnd then flying off as vultures\nAnd a universe beyond\nInnocent of the real air of death\nThat awaited down the path\nAt the very end of 2002, I took the Microphones name and crumpled it up\nAnd burned it in a cave on the frozen edge of northern Norway\nI made a boundary between two eras of my life\nA feeble gesture at making chaos seem organized\nThe roaring river carves on, laughing at my efforts\nWhile the idea of something called \"Mount Eerie\" engulfed me\nAnd time\nRefuses to stop\nMany, many years later\nI heard \"Freezing Moon\" by Mayhem\nAnd these words jumped out:\n\"The cemetery lights up again\"\n\"Eternity opens\"\nAnd I say:\n\"Nothing stays the same\nNo one knows anything\nSomeone else lives in the house I used to live in\nAnd soon it will be torn down or burn\"\nAnd who would even want to live in a prolonged stagnation?\nI am older now and I no longer feel the same way\nThat I did even five seconds ago\nWatch me thrash around\nAnd try to gracefully allow the past to hang\nLike: \"No big deal\"\nBands that break up and then reunite for money can do whatever they want\nBut it makes me glad that I am only this one contrary grump, impossible to reunite\nLive\nThe present moment burns\nI will never stop singing this song\nIt goes on forever\nI started when I was a kid and I still want to hold it lightly\nThis luxurious privilege to sit around\nFrowning and wondering what it means\nPlaying with words\nAnd trying to prove that names mean nothing\nA finger\nPointed at the moon\nMistaken\nFor something shining and true\nI never used to think I'd still be sitting here at forty-one\nTrying to breathe calmly through the waves\nBut nothing's really changed in this effort that never ends\nWhen I took my shirt off in the yard\nI meant it, and it's still off\nI'm still standing in the weather\nLooking for meaning in the giant meaningless\nDays of love and loss repeatedly waterfalling down\nAnd the sun\nRelentlessly rises still\nIt seems like I'll never not lose wisdom\nConstantly relearning all the basics\nNever recognizing any faces\nCrawling out from under living layers\nSquinting in the light of the earth bathing\nShaking off the weight of expectations\nPlus all this nostalgia is embarrassing\nSo I walk into an unknown room\nWithout a name\nSo what if I label this song \"Microphones in 2020\"?\nI hope the absurdity that permeates everything joyfully\nRushes out and floods the room like water from the ceiling\nUndermining all of our delicate stabilities\nAdmitting that each moment is a new collapsing building\nNothing is true\nBut this trembling, laughing in the wind\nAnyway, every song I've ever sung is about the same thing:\nStanding on the ground looking around, basically\nAnd if there have to be words, they could just be:\n\"Now only\"\nAnd\n\"There's no end\"12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "lyrics": "I had this dream where I figured out how to breathe underwater by blowing my mouth full with an air bubble and then re-breathing that old air. I was swimming around someplace tropical and I saw the ripply image of three of my friends playing on the beach. 2 boys and 1 girl. They were throwing rocks at each other and pissing in the sand and the girl kept talking about how she thought she was pregnant and how her mom was so scared. These friends were years younger than me, middle school and totally nuts.  Super-duper teenage riot with obsessions and grudges to spare. And the contrast between their shredded pants and stinky breath and the palm trees and white foam water. I saw this from underwater, I was settling in. Closed my eyes even, but like a big rumble in the distance when a jet flies over or when the crickets stop, a tidal wave lifted me up and I swam through it, watching its shadow gobble up my friends. My watery yells were worthless. The wave smashed them and I saw the girl cry. She broke into pieces and fell down in between the white coral and turquoise fish, her multi-colored hair still contrasted the beauty there.  I woke up and missed them because I hadn't seen them for so longEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
